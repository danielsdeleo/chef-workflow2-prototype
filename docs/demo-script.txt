$ cat Metalfile

=> default config for how dev and test VM instances are launched
=> probably defaults to vagrant, but could have commented out instructions for
   a "null" provisioner to manually managed VM or whatever.

$ wf2 converge local

=> Error: you must compile your policy with `wf2 compile` before
  converging

$ wf2 compile

> Compiling ./Policyfile

## DISCUSSION ##
# In the interest of speed (and quick dev feedback) we want to avoid
# hitting the network wherever possible. Therefore, we want to avoid
# recomputing the entire dependency solution (which may include git or
# cookbook site operations). However, we also don't want to create a
# situation where users are required to constantly type the same command
# over and over again.
#
# Because we've chosen to generate cookbook identifiers from the content
# of the cookbooks, we need to ensure that the identifiers for on-disk
# cookbooks are updated before we upload them to the outside world or
# use the identifiers for comparison (e.g., a `diff` tool)

$ wf2 converge local

$ wf2 test unit

$ wf2 test integration

=> runs TK

$ $EDITOR hack code

## Note: `sh bin/update-demo-files.sh` is a stand-in for this step

=> Make the cookbook(s) do more than just print stuff

$ less Policyfile

=> Note the below lines are changed:

=> default_attributes "hello-message" => "This is from policy attributes."

$ less cookbooks/demo/recipes/default.rb

=> Note the below lines are changed:
=> include_recipe "postgresql"

## DISCUSSION:##
# This step is only required if we suppose we're using a community
# cookbook, which might come a lot later in the related learnchef
# content for this tool.

$ wf2 converge development

=> create/resume VM, run
=> see output from chef run

$ wf2 login development

$ wf2 diff ENV_NAME

=> See what changed:
* cookbook demo from Nothing => 0.1.0
* cookbook postgres from Nothing => x.y.z
* attribute default["hello_message"] from Nothing => "hello"

$ wf2 deploy ENV_NAME (or cell name, whatever)

=> user hasn't configured any server, so prompt them to figure this out...

$ $EDITOR hack server creds

=> get client.pem, username

$ wf2 deploy ENV_NAME (or cell name, whatever)

=> upload cookbooks
=> upload policy, apply to env/cell/deploy-group

##QUESTION##
what now? provision a node w/ chef-metal?
future pushy integration will be cool, not in 1.0

$ wf2 apply? $VERB

## Possible cmds: ##

`wf2 provision`: create some nodes from Metalfile
`wf2 up/push`: just upload objects to chef server
`wf2 deploy`: figures out what nodes should get the changes, provision if necessary, do up/push, ssh-to-chef?
